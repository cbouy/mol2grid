Got stuck:
- Interactive template: The tooltip should be attached to the cell instead of the image.
    Tooltip on the image overlays the content and sometimes also the info button, causing a flicker.
    Implementation commented out - look for %%% inside molgrid.py
- I don't understand why for mols2grid-id-display to show up it needs to be a copy of mols2grid-id. We should just be able to use mols2grid-id
    See mols2grid-id-display inside molgrid.py

Later:
- When clicking on svg line, we're triggering the copy action and the image blinks, this shouldn't be the case
- Make tooltip copy-able
- Render PNGs transparent as well, with option to make them opaque
- When the tooltip is activated, it should follow the cell in focus (the same way as how the static works)

Update docs:
- make_popup_callback has extra img parameter - needed?
- We should include <hr> in the popup docs example
