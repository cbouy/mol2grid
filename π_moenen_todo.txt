NEED HELP: 
- Attach tooltip to the cell. When we succeed, we should move tabindex="0" to the cell instead of the image in the static template


- With tooltip ON, would be nice if it follows the element focus (only in static now)
- Make tooltip copy-able
- Update main function docstring

- Send back selected molecules as panda dataframe back to Python (fallback: copy to clipboard?)
    --> callback with selected ids, which then are used to filter the dataframe

- Would be nice to have SVGs rendered transparent, with an option


√ - Figure out tooltip_trigger for static template
√ - Turn tooltip off by default for static template
