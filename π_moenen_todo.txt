NEED HELP: 
- Attach tooltip to the cell. When we succeed, we should move tabindex="0" to the cell instead of the image in the static template
- mols2grid.get_selection() doesn't return anything?

Later:
- Make tooltip copy-able
- Render PNGs transparent as well, with option to make them opaque
- When the tooltip is activated, it should follow the cell in focus (the same way as how the static works)


√ - Update main function docstring
√ - Figure out tooltip_trigger for static template
√ - Turn tooltip off by default for static template
√ - When saving SMILES/CSV without anything being selected, download ALL
√ - Check if all python css options still work
√ - info button active state broken when there's custom border set
√ - Test if sort_by used to work with original module
√ - Check if truncation defaults are set correctly for static/interactive
√ - Fix up/down arrows in grid
√ - Rename pages/table to interactive/static
x - Centralize python variables
√ - Merge tooltip doc strings for to_interactive
√ - Check how width & cell_width work and update doc
√ - Remove variable literals in CSS towards bottom
√ - Implements up/down tooltip
√ - Fix functions responsivity
√ - Make sure img subset is always first in list
√ - Set tabindex -1 on checkboxes and 0 on cells
